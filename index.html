                <h1>Early beginnings...</h1>
                <p>As a student of Computer Science in High School I got my first experience with making a program from
                    scratch that had a database and a UI.</p>
                <p>We learnt

                        class="icon" alt=""/> Python and <img src="https://www.mysql.com/common/logos/logo-mysql-170x115.png"
                        class="icon" alt=""/> MySQL at the time. So our project was a game made using pygame that utilised a
                    local
                    mysql database for a simple leaderboard.</p>

                <h1>Level Up</h1>
                <p>In the first semester of college I once again learnt Python at a more advance level. I was introduced
                    to
                    concepts like OOPs, modularity etc.</p>
                <p>I also learnt Tkinter which is another way to make UI in Python. As part of our course requirements
                    we
                    implemented another game using Tkinter as the UI.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="para align-right">
            <div class="code-bracket" onclick="goToGit('https://github.com/praakhya/second-semester-computer-project.git')">
                <div class="code">
                    <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        code
                    </span>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h1>Something new</h1>
                <p>The next language I learnt was <img
                        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg"
                        class="icon" />. After rigourously using Python for 2 years, switching to C provided with a new
                    challenge. However, in the end it proved to be a good experience. Though type safety is a concept
                    that python chooses to avoid, on getting used to it, it can be very useful, specially in debugging.
                </p>
                <p>Just as before, we were assigned to make project for this course. We implemented a calculator that
                    did calculations other than the usual such as base conversions, matrix arithmetic and geomteric
                    shape metrics.</p>

                <h1>The World of Web Devlopment</h1>
                <p>In the third semester one of the major projects we were tasked with was a full stack web application.
                    This was the first time I was introduced to the deeper parts of web development aside from the basic
                    HTML and CSS we are taught in school.</p>
                <p>Our course was for learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJs, React, NodeJs).</p>
                <p>As a side product of the project I learnt how to handle JSON files and how servers worked. This was
                    an interesting project and it provided me with a lot of knowledge that still comes in handy today,
                    because in today's world a website can be a useful way to communicate with people over the internet.
                </p>
                <p>Our project was a book store/ book management application. At that point in time we implemented
                    simple CRUD operations.</p>
